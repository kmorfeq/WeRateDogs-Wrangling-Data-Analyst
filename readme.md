## Dataset

> The WeRateDogs dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.


## Summary of Findings

> The data sets are not ready, yet, and need to be cleaned before the researcher can depends on it.
The tweet prediction with 100% confidence was wrong. Thus, the training algorithm for this neural network needs to be modified to avoid any similar issue in the future.
The algorithm predicts that some images doesn't have a dog in it although it's a dog's image.
The source of most of the tweets was from IPhone.
Most image doesn't have names.
The algorithm can't predict a dog_stage for most of the images.
